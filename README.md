# Welcome

Welcome to Quantum Software Engineer homepage.&#x20;

### What is Quantum Software Engineering?

Wikipedia definitions of software engineering are strangely circular.

I define software engineering as the development, extension, optimization and maintenance of a programming language or its parts. The programming language is how the intentions of humans are communicated to machines who execute the instructions they receive.

With the invention of quantum computers, we need languages to communicate efficiently with a whole new type of machine.

> _"The challenge of quantum software engineering is to rework and extend the whole of classical software engineering into the quantum domain so that programmers can manipulate quantum programs with the same ease and confidence that they manipulate today’s classical programs.”_&#x20;

### What is this website about?

We will document both the foundational algorithms and latest state-of-the-art software implementations of quantum computing, all from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

This might interest you if you -

* are a programmer learning quantum computing through hands-on coding experience, and/or
* know a bit of quantum physics but not quantum computing, and/or
* want to keep up with the latest progress in the rapidly evolving quantum computing industry.

### That sounds great? How do I follow this?
